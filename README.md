# This Project is a template for creating web projects. 
# The dist folder is for the preprocessed css file gotten from the sass compilation (sass --watch app/scss:dist)
# The vendors-extensions sass partial folder is for your library files override, you don't have to have it if you don't need it. 
# Remember, it's a template, you can modify it to fit your project
